# NotesTest
Simple test repo to capture and store web notes for later

Plan to create a simple web server with Node.js and JS to capture notes. Using the Github API, saving a note will send it to a Github repo (such as my second brain) to a specific folder. Inbox, maybe?

Just sending Markdown files so this shouldn't be too difficult. I can / should be able to use some of the code / experience from my [GH CMS project](https://myconscious.stream/blog/My-personal-CMS-prototype/).
